## ðŸ“Œ Issue: Video elements losing their mute state on navigation
### **Problem**
- There are two video elements in separate routes.
- The first video is **muted**, and the second is **unmuted**.
- When navigating back from the second to the first, the muted state is lost.

### **Solution**
âœ… Implemented **`useEffect` hook** to explicitly set the muted state on mount:

```typescript
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";

export default function VideoComponent({ muted }: { muted: boolean }) {
  const videoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (videoRef.current) {
      videoRef.current.muted = muted;
    }
  }, [muted]);

  return <video ref={videoRef} autoPlay muted={muted} />;
}
